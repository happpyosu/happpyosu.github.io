  I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Microelectronics Thrust at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou Campus (HKUST-GZ), under the guidance of Prof. Tong Yeyu. I hold both an M.S. degree and a B.E. degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT). My research interests focus on photonic integrated circuits, including silicon photonics, and their applications in high-speed interconnects, sensing, and imaging, as well as design automation.
